    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    And I enter "Foobaz" for "Media name"
    And I press "Save and publish"
    # Queue the image for deletion now so it will be deleted even if the
    # test fails.
    And I queue the latest media entity for deletion
    Then I should be visiting a media entity
